Project website for MadLab's Intro to WebDev course

## description of my site
For my project, I decided to test everything I had learned about JS, CSS, and HTML and also challenge myself to go further with it. Lets look at things that I have included within my pages. Accessibility (alt text within the HTML, option to change the GIF version of background to more simplistic plain colours). Click on the images and watch them change! Hover over the directors on the first page to see who they are. Fake polls using CSS. Rock/Paper/Scissors game using JS. Embedded music. Enter name greeting. Real time working clock using JS. A 'Movie Watchlist' which you can add or delete films from, which will not reset when you refresh the page (using JSON). Automatically vertical scrolling images using CSS. An art application using JS. A quiz out of five, where you can test how much you know about me, Amelie, and my film tastes.
